## Development

### Modifying Quests

Edit `quests.lua` to add or modify NPCs and quests:

```lua
-- Add a new NPC
{
    id = "npc_unique_id",
    x = 300,
    y = 300,
    size = 16,
    name = "NPC Name",
    questId = "quest_id",
    isQuestGiver = true
}

-- Add a new quest
quest_id = {
    id = "quest_id",
    name = "Quest Name",
    description = "Quest description",
    questGiver = "npc_unique_id",
    requiredItem = "item_id",
    reward = "Reward text",
    active = false,
    completed = false
}
```

### Editing Maps

1. Open `tiled/map.tmx` in [Tiled Map Editor](https://www.mapeditor.org/)
2. Edit tiles and properties
3. Export as Lua: File â†’ Export As â†’ map.lua
4. Ensure collision properties are set on wall tiles

### Adding Sprites

Place 16x16 pixel PNG files in the `sprites/` or `tiles/` directory and load them in `main.lua`:

```lua
local newSprite = love.graphics.newImage("sprites/new_sprite.png")
newSprite:setFilter("nearest", "nearest")
```
